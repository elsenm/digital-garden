# Introduction
Welcome to my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). This is my [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) book based on a [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) hosted on my personal web server and mirrored on [GitHub](https://github.com/elsenm/digital-garden/blob/master/vimwiki/main.md).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, you can just start reading from the top entry down and see what sparks your interest. You can quickly search the contents of this wiki by using the search bar in the top right or you can explore the navigation bar at the top left together with the tree view on the left. Each page is a topic that can include other sub-topics under it related to the parent topic.

In this digital garden you will find all the notes I've made on a huge variety of topics, including, but not limited to:

* Software development
* Software in general
* Chinese
* Tea
* Travelling
* Self-improvement
* Productivity
* Note-taking

I update this wiki [almost daily](https://github.com/elsenm/digital-garden/commits/master) and use it myself for my own reference. I mostly write things and structure them in a way that I can understand and access them the best, and reference what I know easily and quickly.

# Grow Your Own Digital Garden
