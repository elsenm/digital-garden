# What Is Tea?
Leaves from the tea plant, scientifically known as [_Camellia sinensis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis).

There are two major varieties:

- _C. sinensis var. sinensis_, also known as _small leaf_
- _C. sinensis var. assamica_, also known as _big leaf_

Contrary to popular belief and despite their misleading names _herbal teas_ and _fruit teas_ are **not** _true_ teas. More accurate and correct names for them would be _herbal infusions_, _infusions of fruit_ or more eloquently _tisanes_.

This FAQ will focus solely on true teas.

# Types of Tea
- White tea（白茶）
- Green tea（綠茶）
- Yellow tea（黃茶）
- Oolong tea（烏龍茶，literally _black dragon tea_, or 青茶，literally _blue-green tea_)
- Black tea（紅茶，literally _red tea_)
- (Post-)Fermented tea / Dark tea (黑茶，literally _black tea_)

## White Tea
White tea is the least processed. It is wilted and unoxidized. Its name derives from the white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which give the plant a whitish appearance. Please note that not all white teas have that type of appearance and that brewed white tea is usually a pale yellow.

## Green Tea
It is unwilted and unoxidized.

## Yellow Tea
Yellow tea is similar to green tea but with an added step of encasing and steaming the tea, that also gives the leaves a slightly yellow coloring during the drying process. It is unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow. It's the rarest and most expensive type of tea.

## Oolong Tea
It is wilted, bruised, and partially oxidized.

## Black Tea
It is wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized.

## Dark Tea
It is green tea that has been allowed to ferment/compost.

# Fermented or Oxidized
Apart from [dark teas](#dark-tea), tea is never fermented. The tea leaves contain [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) that react with the oxygen in the air as soon as they are picked from the tea tree. Thus, tea leaves turn dark due to an enzymatic oxidation process which breaks down the [chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll), the green pigments of the leaves. This is also often referred to as [browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_browning) and is the exact same process a banana or an apple undergoes when you slice it open and leave it for a while.

The process of fermentation always requires the activity of microorganisms, for exampe certain bacteria or fungi, to bring about a desirable change to food or beverages. The use of such microoganisms only appears in the production of [dark teas, also known as post-fermented teas](#dark-tea).

# Oolong and Qing Cha
While in the West the term Oolong is used almost exclusively to refer to this type of tea, in Chinese speaking areas of the world you may also hear the word 青茶 (qīng chá) in this context. There seems to be conflicting information on the internet about whether or not Oolong and Qing Cha are the same thing. According to the [Chinese Wikipedia entry of Qing Cha](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9D%92%E8%8C%B6), Oolong is a sub-type of Qing Cha, along with Tie Guan Yin. The [entry for Tie Guan Yin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%93%81%E8%A7%82%E9%9F%B3), on the other hand, contradictorily mentions that it's a type of Oolong. [Oolong tea's entry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B9%8C%E9%BE%99%E8%8C%B6) states, however, that Oolong and Qing Cha are precisely the same thing. So, for all intents and purposes I think it's safe to consider Oolong tea and Qing Cha to refer to the exact type of tea, of which teas like Tie Guan Yin are a variant of.
