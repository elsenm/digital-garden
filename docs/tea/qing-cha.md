While in the West the term Oolong is used almost exclusively to refer to this type of tea, in Chinese speaking areas of the world you may also hear the word 青茶 (qīng chá) in this context. There seems to be conflicting information on the internet about whether or not Oolong and Qing Cha are the same thing. According to the [Chinese Wikipedia entry of Qing Cha](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9D%92%E8%8C%B6), Oolong is a sub-type of Qing Cha, along with Tie Guan Yin. The [entry for Tie Guan Yin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%93%81%E8%A7%82%E9%9F%B3), on the other hand, contradictorily mentions that it's a type of Oolong. [Oolong tea's entry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B9%8C%E9%BE%99%E8%8C%B6) states, however, that Oolong and Qing Cha are precisely the same thing. So, for all intents and purposes I think it's safe to consider Oolong tea and Qing Cha to refer to the exact type of tea, of which teas like Tie Guan Yin are a variant of.
