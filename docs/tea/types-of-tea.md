# White Tea
White tea is the least processed. It is wilted and unoxidized. Its name derives from the white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which give the plant a whitish appearance. Please note that not all white teas have that type of appearance and that brewed white tea is usually a pale yellow.

# Green Tea
It is unwilted and unoxidized.

# Yellow Tea
Yellow tea is similar to green tea but with an added step of encasing and steaming the tea, that also gives the leaves a slightly yellow coloring during the drying process. It is unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow. It's the rarest and most expensive type of tea.

# Oolong Tea
It is wilted, bruised, and partially oxidized.

# Black Tea
It is wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized.

# Dark Tea
It is green tea that has been allowed to ferment/compost.
