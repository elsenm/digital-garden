Leaves from the tea plant, scientifically known as [_Camellia sinensis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis).

There are two major varieties:

- _C. sinensis var. sinensis_, also known as _small leaf_
- _C. sinensis var. assamica_, also known as _big leaf_

Contrary to popular belief and despite their misleading names _herbal teas_ and _fruit teas_ are **not** _true_ teas. More accurate and correct names for them would be _herbal infusions_, _infusions of fruit_ or more eloquently _tisanes_.
