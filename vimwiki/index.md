I am Marvin Elsen.

I am a passionate German software developer and information security enthusiast.

Empowering people through exceptional and great-looking software is what drives me to becoming my greatest version. Perfection and user-friendliness take the highest priority and are the reason I put more than 100% of effort into everything I do and always aim for the top.

Steve Jobs has always been a huge source of inspiration and motivation for me and I am a firm believer of the UNIX Philosphy: writing short, simple, clear, modular, and extensible code. While I also do use Windows, I feel most comfortable on Linux.

Apart from coding I am also skilled at creating 3D and 2D assets specifically for games and other virtual environments. When I am not busy working on projects I love to spend my time studying the Chinese language, tinkering with Linux systems and researching IT-Security topics to broaden my knowledge.
